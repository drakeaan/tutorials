# General tutorials for me to learn and practice Python and shell scripting.

## Main takeways so far:
 - Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies listed in the requirements file.
 - Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to create a requirements file with all the installed packages and their versions.
 - Use `pip install --upgrade <package>` to upgrade a specific package.
 - Use `pip uninstall <package>` to uninstall a specific package.
 - Use `pip list` to list all installed packages and their versions.

### Python:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and versatility. It is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.
Python's syntax is designed to be easy to read and write, making it a popular choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a large standard library and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

There seems to be a lot of overlap with C++ especially in the syntax. I think I will be able to pick it up quickly.

Numerical values seems to prefer the C++ style of 0.L for floats/doubles and 0 for integers. I think this is a good idea as it makes it clear what type of number you are dealing with. I will try to stick to this style in my code even in C# to make it easier to switch between languages.
